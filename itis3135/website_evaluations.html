    <h2>Website Evaluations</h2>

    <p>
      This page looks at two websites and checks how they follow the CRAP design principles.
      CRAP stands for Contrast, Repetition, Alignment, and Proximity. These are simple rules
      that help make a site easy to use and nice to look at.
    </p>

    <section>
      <h3>
        <a href="https://www.apple.com" target="_blank">Apple</a>
      </h3>
      <p>
        Apple’s website shows their products with a clean and modern design.
        The layout is simple, the visuals are bold, and it reflects Apple’s branding.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Good use of white space and bold visuals. Text stands out clearly.</li>
        <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Fonts, colors, and layouts are the same across the site.</li>
        <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Has grid-based layout keeps everything balanced and easy to follow.</li>
        <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Related content is grouped together, making information easy to find.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>
        <a href="http://thebiguglywebsite.com" target="_blank">The Big Ugly Website</a>
      </h3>
      <p>
        The Big Ugly Website is intentionally designed to look terrible. It’s cluttered,
        chaotic, and makes it hard for users to focus on important content.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Colors clash, making text and elements difficult to read.</li>
        <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Styles are inconsistent, different fonts and colors everywhere.</li>
        <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Elements feel randomly placed with no structure.</li>
        <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Information is everywhere on the page, and related items are not grouped together.</li>
      </ul>
